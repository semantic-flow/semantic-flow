On every new task, first read the file `.ai-guidance.md` at the workspace root.

That file references:
1. `sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.contributors.general-guidance.md`
2. `sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.contributors.djradon.ai-guidance.md`
3. All ontologies under the `ontology/` folder

Ensure the content of these resources is loaded into your context before you begin work.
